Navigate to the web_server directory:
sh
Copy code
cd web_server
Run the web server:
sh
Copy code
node server.js
Ensure the web server is running on your desired IP address and port (default is http://localhost:3000).
Step 4: Host the Website on RDP or Your Hacking Machine
Make sure your web server is accessible from the network. You may need to configure port forwarding or firewall settings to allow external access.
Test the web server by navigating to http://<your-server-ip>:3000 in a web browser.
Step 5: Deploy the Payload
Plug the Rubber Ducky Pi Pico into the victim machine.
The Pi Pico will execute the payload, which includes accessing your web server and uploading necessary data.
